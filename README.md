![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/JariKCoding/CoD-Bo3-4-Lua-Disassembler/total.svg)

This is a tool that allows you to disassemble compiled lua files from CoD: Black ops 3 and 4.
Im not providing a tool to extract these files from the game to prevent leaks.

To use the program just drag the compiled lua file onto the .exe file
